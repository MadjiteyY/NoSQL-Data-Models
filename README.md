# NoSQL-Data-Models

### Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is 
particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results,
since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, 
and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you 
by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.


### Project Steps

Below are steps followed to complete each component of this project.

Modeling NoSQL database or Apache Cassandra database:

* Design tables to answer the queries outlined in the project template

* Write Apache Cassandra CREATE KEYSPACE and SET KEYSPACE statements

* Develop CREATE statement for each of the tables to address each question

* Load the data with INSERT statement for each of the tables
